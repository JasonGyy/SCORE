Inacceptable low discretization for this high number of nuclei.
I have been made familiar with 2 ideal texture components that are used for texture volume analyses.
14, logpoints for RXFront defragmentation were initialized as desired and sorted ascending.
101, logpoints for X were initialized as desired and sorted in ascending order.
1, is the upper limit for RXFRACTION numerical integration scheme.
36000, is the upper limit for REALTIME numerical integration scheme.
0.2, is the initial recaching value.
1, is the total number of automata in the MPI_COMM_WORLD.
1e-06, is the cellsize.
0.1, is the MAXFILLPERSTEP.
200;200;200, is RD x ND x TD CA geometry.

0 myRank,jobid = 0 local CA simulation was successfully executed, tsimend = 468.308, stepsimend = 309
The MASTER has output profiling information regarding the simulation.
The overall worldmax_tsimend is between 468.308 and 468.308
Master outputs his own results nid=947
Simulation finished with some new insights into pRX, skal.
